<div><p style="color:black"><a>FAVORITE At some point during the Void Century, a man named Joy Boy came across an island located at the end of the Grand Line. Here, he left behind a treasure of unimaginable value.[2] Stories of this treasure on the final island peaked the interest of Gol D. Roger, and he took the World Government forbidding exploration of the island as evidence of it being real.[3]

Only the members of the Roger Pirates that journeyed to the island know what exactly the treasure consists of. Upon arriving on the island and seeing Joy Boy's treasure, the Roger Pirates simply began to laugh. Roger described it as a "tale full of laughs", which gave him the idea to name the final island "Laugh Tale".[2] Sometime after the Roger Pirates' discovery, the world at large would begin to refer to Roger's treasures as the "One Piece".[1]

Before Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates.

The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about One Piece.</a></div></p>

<div><p style="color:black"><a>USER's INFORMATION Alternatively referred to as an account name, login ID, nickname, and user ID, username or user name is the name given to a user on a computer or computer network. This name is commonly an abbreviation of the user's full name or his or her alias. For example, an individual known as John Smith may be assigned the username smitj, the first four letters of the last name followed by the first letter of the first name. The picture shown on this page shows the username as root.

Usernames allow multiple users to use the same computer or online service with their personal settings and files. When used on a website, a username enables you to maintain personal settings and identification with that website or service. With most services, your username is a name you created, or one assigned to you. If you do not recall creating a username, or don't remember the name you chose, try using your e-mail address as your username. If your e-mail address does not work, and you are trying to log into a service where you have an account number, try using that number.

If none of the above suggestions work, most services have a forgot username or forgot password service that send you your username through e-mail. In most cases, a link for this feature is found under or around where you enter your username and password.</a></div></p>

<div><p style="color:black"><a>FAMILY, a group of persons united by the ties of marriage, blood, or adoption, constituting a single household and interacting with each other in their respective social positions, usually those of spouses, parents, children, and siblings. The family group should be distinguished from a household, which may include boarders and roomers sharing a common residence. It should also be differentiated from a kindred (which also concerns blood lines), because a kindred may be divided into several households. Frequently the family is not differentiated from the marriage pair, but the essence of the family group is the parent-child relationship, which may be absent from many marriage pairs. The traditional family consists of a father, mother, and children. This is the nuclear family often shown on television as the familial standard. However, the 21st century showcases various family units, some very different from the standard unit of prior decades. Today, children are often raised in single-parent homes, by grandparents, or by LGBTQ+ parents. Some families opt to have no children or cannot have children due to medical or emotional barriers. The idea that parents and children make a family is a basic definition; however, to accurately acknowledge other family structures, a broader definition is necessary. In addition to a universal family definition, plenty of people consider a group of friends to be family, and many consider pets as defining members of the family unit.

Who comprises a family is up to the people in the family themselves. People may opt to keep blood relatives in their lives, or let them go if they are toxic to their well-being. Many folks add caring and supportive people to their extended clan when they choose, deciding who belongs in their specific definition of family.</a></div></p>
